Title: The Mystery of Ariana Venti
<br>
This is my very first post on this blog and coincidentally, the start of our final project!
<br>
A bit of context: Our three weeks of CS4CS camp culminate into a final major project - solving a mystery using skills like encrypting, decrypting, innovative problem-solving, intercepting files, and bringing up more than meets the eye in files. 
<br>
Today began the main challenge: to solve the mysterious disappearance of Ariana Venti. As we walked into the classroom, posters and articles ripped out of newspapers dotted the walls, proclaiming headlines like ‘Ariana’s Disappearing Act’ and ‘Missing: Ariana Venti’. Looking closer, we saw that Ariana had disappeared 11 days ago, on Sunday July 8. Nobody seems to know where she went, but one article said that her assistant reported Ariana getting an emergency text from a family member.
<br>
We got a letter from a ‘Michelle Ohana’ recruiting us for a mission to solve the Ariana Venti case. We were escorted into Ariana’s dressing room, which had a purse(presumed to be Ariana’s) containing slime and an encrypted letter. It read: 
<br>
Hey Beyond-C:

Because there were three different letters used for single-letter words(a, s, q), I knew that it couldn’t be a simple Caesar code, which associates each letter of the alphabet with a different one in a circular fashion. The next logical step would be to try a Vigenere code, which uses a key word to associate each letter in a message with a different, seemingly random, letter. There were only two things in that purse: the letter and slime, so I tried ‘SLIME’ as the vigenere code. It worked, leaving a message:
<br>
Hey Beyond-C:
<br>
I have a message for you, but i must tell you in secret. Can you please get on my laptop and do the ykw[You-know-what]?
<br>
XOXO
A
<br>
This ‘you-know-what’ is very mysterious -- could it lead to the whereabouts of Ariana Venti?
<br>
Hopefully we’ll gain access to Ariana’s laptop soon, but this is all that I have for today! I wonder what the next step on our mission will be and what very famous, very real celebrities will come into play!
